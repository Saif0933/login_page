1.Semantic HTML Structure:
Focus: Build a clean, accessible foundation. Use proper HTML5 tags (<form>, <label>, <input>, <button>). Associate labels explicitly with inputs using the for attribute.
2.CSS for Styling & Basic Transitions:
Focus: Define the visual appearance (layout, colors, typography) and handle simple, state-based animations using CSS transition.
3.JavaScript for Interaction & Logic:
Focus: Handle user interactions (clicks, input events, form submission), perform client-side validation (checking if fields are empty, email format is correct, etc.), and manage the logic of when animations should occur.
Why: JS is essential for reacting to user actions dynamically. It determines if and when an error animation should play, or when to show a loading spinner.
It make with the help of HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT
